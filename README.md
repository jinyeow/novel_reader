## Installation

TODO

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `novel_reader` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:novel_reader, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `novel_reader` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:novel_reader]]
    end
    ```
